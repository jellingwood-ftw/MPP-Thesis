# MPP-Thesis
This repository contains all the .Rmd files, figures, and tables used to write *It's like Uber, but for deepening political inequality: Estimating the impact of platform economy work on workers' political interest and turnout in the UK* which was submitted in May 2022 for the degree of Master of Public Policy at the Hertie School, Berlin. 

## RMD Files
Note that the files are numbered 01-06:
- 01_setup.Rmd file provides information on the wrangling of the dataset, including variable definitions. 
- 02_Voting_impute.Rmd details how I imputed missing observations for voter turnout
- 03_prob_models.Rmd contains the main analysis
- 04_UK_descr.Rmd provides the code for the descriptive visualizations
- 05_Matching.Rmd provides the code for the Propensity Score Matching analysis done as a robustness check.
- 06_RC_Employed-Persons.Rmd does the basic analysis, but with the subgroup of employed people as the control units.
